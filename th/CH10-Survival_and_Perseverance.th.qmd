## Koh Tao: Hell on Earth

The transfer to Koh Tao in 1943 brought the harshest conditions So had yet endured, testing his physical and mental resilience as he struggled to survive while completing his life's work.

So Sethaputra spent the next fifteen months, from April 1943 to July 1944, on Koh Tao island, and it would prove to be the most grueling period of his eleven-year imprisonment. Like Tarutao, Koh Tao is today a paradise for holidaymakers, with long stretches of white sandy beaches fringed by miles of coconut palm trees and surrounded by clear waters and beautiful coral reefs. Unlike Tarutao, however, Koh Tao was much smaller and less fertile, with little freshwater resources. The prisoners were confined to an area of just fourteen acres, surrounded by a fence and overlooked by a watchtower with a machine gun emplacement positioned on a hill that allowed the prison guards to maintain constant surveillance. Escape was not even a theoretical possibility.

The transfer from the relative freedom and community they had built on Tarutao (as described in @sec-tarutao-exile) to this constrained and hostile environment represented a shocking regression in their conditions of confinement. The war that had transformed Thailand into a Japanese ally (detailed in @sec-war-comes-siam) had fundamentally altered the government's approach to political prisoners. They were no longer viewed as misguided patriots who might eventually be reconciled to the new order, but as dangerous enemies whose very existence threatened national security.

The newly arrived prisoners would soon discover that Koh Tao was hell on earth. The Department of Corrections had changed their liberal policy, and political prisoners under sixty were forced to work like slaves. They were no longer allowed to wander around freely, and at night they were locked up like common criminals. The transformation in their treatment reflected the broader militarization of Thai society under wartime pressures and the government's increasing paranoia about potential security threats.

## The Regime of Forced Labor

The harsh labor regime imposed on Koh Tao was designed not merely to punish the political prisoners but to break their spirit and destroy their capacity for intellectual resistance. The educated men who had once been treated with a grudging respect for their expertise and social position were now subjected to backbreaking physical labor that seemed calculated to humiliate them as much as to exploit their bodies.

The prisoners were forced to perform the most demanding and dangerous work on the island: clearing jungle, building structures, and maintaining the prison facilities under the tropical sun. The work was exhausting for men in their prime; for middle-aged intellectuals who had spent their careers in offices and classrooms, it was devastating. The guards showed no consideration for age, health, or previous social status in assigning work details, treating former cabinet ministers and university professors with the same brutality they might have shown to convicted murderers.

The psychological impact of forced labor was as destructive as its physical effects. Men who had built their identities around intellectual achievement and social status found themselves reduced to manual laborers whose only value lay in their capacity for physical work. The dignified bearing that had sustained them through years of imprisonment gradually eroded under the relentless pressure of exhausting labor and constant humiliation.

For So personally, the forced labor regime represented a catastrophic threat to the dictionary project that had sustained him through years of confinement. The physical exhaustion that resulted from daily labor left little energy for intellectual work, while the constant surveillance made it virtually impossible to maintain the secrecy that had protected his scholarly activities. The careful routines and collaborative relationships that had enabled his work on Tarutao were completely disrupted by the harsh realities of life on Koh Tao.

## The Deadly Combination of Hardships

There was an acute shortage of essential medicines on Koh Tao, and American submarine patrols in the gulf had curtailed regular delivery of basic foods and supplies. Malnutrition became a major problem, and there were more malarial cases than the prisoners had experienced on Tarutao. The combination of exhaustive work, sunstroke, severe hunger, and malaria created a deadly environment that claimed six prisoners in the first two months alone. They were literally worked to death.

The medical crisis on Koh Tao reflected both the island's isolation and the government's reduced commitment to prisoner welfare during wartime. The medical supplies that had been barely adequate on Tarutao were completely insufficient for the more challenging conditions on Koh Tao. The lack of quinine, the primary treatment for malaria, meant that prisoners who contracted the disease faced a significant risk of death without proper medical intervention.

The food situation was equally desperate. The self-sufficient agricultural system that Prince Sithiporn had developed on Tarutao could not be replicated on the smaller, less fertile Koh Tao. The prisoners were dependent on supply boats that arrived irregularly and often carried insufficient quantities of basic necessities. The combination of reduced rations and increased physical demands created a nutritional crisis that weakened the prisoners' resistance to disease and exhaustion.

The water shortage on Koh Tao was perhaps the most critical problem of all. Unlike Tarutao, which had abundant freshwater streams, Koh Tao's limited water resources were barely sufficient for the prison population. The poor quality of available water, combined with inadequate sanitation facilities, created ideal conditions for the spread of waterborne diseases that further weakened the already vulnerable prisoner population.

## So's Physical Decline

These harsh conditions were not conducive for So to continue his scholarly work. He was planning to write the life story of King Rama V, but the lack of research materials, the rough conditions in the prison camp, and severe debilitation made So give up writing for the first time in his adult life. He was down to thirty kilograms and so weak that his friends stood in for him during the strenuous task of chopping logs for firewood. Instead, he was assigned to the lighter job of stacking and counting them.

The physical deterioration that So experienced on Koh Tao was shocking to those who had known him during his earlier imprisonment. The man who had maintained his dignity and bearing throughout years of confinement was reduced to a skeletal figure whose weakness was evident to everyone around him. His weight loss of approximately twenty kilograms represented not merely physical decline but the near-collapse of his body's capacity to sustain life under the extreme conditions of the island prison.

The abandonment of his writing activities represented a profound psychological defeat for So. Throughout his imprisonment, his commitment to scholarly work had provided him with a sense of purpose and identity that transcended his circumstances. The dictionary project had been more than intellectual activity; it had been a form of resistance against the forces that sought to destroy his spirit. His inability to continue writing marked the closest he would come to complete surrender during his years of confinement.

The support he received from his fellow prisoners during this crisis demonstrated the bonds of solidarity that had developed among the political prisoners despite their harsh treatment. Men who were themselves struggling to survive took on additional burdens to protect their weakest comrades, sharing their meager food rations and taking over the most demanding work assignments. This mutual support system was essential to the survival of prisoners like So who might otherwise have died from the combination of malnutrition, disease, and exhaustion.

## The Search for Medical Alternatives

To make up for the lack of intellectual activity, So started new experiments with herbal plants, hoping to find a substitute for much-needed quinine. Boiling borapet and shatterstone plants together produced a bitter liquid that seemed to have some effectiveness against malarial symptoms, though it was far from being a complete substitute for proper medical treatment. These experiments represented both a practical response to the medical crisis and an attempt to maintain some form of intellectual engagement despite his physical weakness.

So's turn to herbal medicine reflected both his scientific training and his desperate circumstances. His background in mining engineering had given him an understanding of chemical processes that enabled him to approach herbal experimentation systematically rather than randomly. He understood that successful treatment would require identifying the active compounds in traditional medicines and determining proper dosages and preparation methods.

The herbal experiments also provided So with a way to contribute to the welfare of his fellow prisoners despite his physical limitations. While he could no longer perform heavy labor or continue his dictionary work, he could use his analytical skills to develop treatments that might help alleviate the medical crisis affecting the entire prison population. This work gave him a sense of purpose and usefulness that helped sustain his morale during the darkest period of his imprisonment.

The limited success of his herbal treatments provided some validation for traditional Thai medicine and demonstrated the potential value of systematic investigation of indigenous remedies. However, the lack of proper research facilities and the extreme conditions under which the experiments were conducted meant that the results were necessarily limited and provisional. So understood that his work was merely a stopgap measure that could not replace proper medical care.

## The Psychology of Survival

The psychological challenges of surviving on Koh Tao were as severe as the physical hardships. The prisoners had to maintain their sanity and sense of human dignity under conditions that seemed designed to reduce them to the level of animals. The constant surveillance, the brutal labor regime, and the perpetual threat of death created an environment of profound psychological stress that tested even the strongest personalities.

For intellectuals like So, the psychological challenges were particularly acute. Their identities had been built around mental rather than physical capabilities, around cultural sophistication rather than brute survival skills. The reduction of their daily existence to the most basic concerns of food, water, and physical survival represented a fundamental assault on their sense of self that was more devastating than mere physical hardship.

The loss of privacy and personal autonomy was especially difficult for men who had been accustomed to positions of authority and respect. The inability to make even the most basic decisions about daily life, combined with the constant humiliation of surveillance and control, created a psychological prison that was as confining as the physical barriers that surrounded them.

Yet despite these enormous challenges, many of the prisoners managed to maintain their essential humanity and dignity. They developed strategies for psychological survival that enabled them to endure conditions that might have broken less resilient individuals. The maintenance of intellectual interests, the preservation of social relationships, and the commitment to mutual support all served as psychological anchors that prevented complete spiritual collapse.

## The Limits of Endurance

The fifteen months that So spent on Koh Tao brought him closer to death than at any other time during his imprisonment. The combination of malnutrition, disease, exhaustion, and psychological stress created a crisis that very nearly claimed his life. His survival was due partly to the support of his fellow prisoners, partly to his own remarkable resilience, and partly to simple luck in avoiding the most deadly diseases that killed several of his companions.

The deaths of six prisoners during the first two months on Koh Tao served as constant reminders of the precariousness of their situation. These men had survived years of imprisonment under various conditions, only to die on an island that was supposedly safer and more secure than their previous locations. Their deaths demonstrated that the government's new approach to political prisoners was not merely punitive but potentially lethal.

For So, the deaths of his companions represented not only personal losses but also the destruction of the intellectual community that had sustained him throughout his imprisonment. Each death reduced the collective knowledge and cultural resources available to the survivors, making their situation more desperate and their future more uncertain. The gradual attrition of the political prisoner population threatened to eliminate entirely the educated elite that had once played such an important role in Thai society.

The realization that he might die on Koh Tao without completing his dictionary or seeing his family again was profoundly disturbing to So. The work that had given meaning to his imprisonment remained unfinished, and the prospect of dying before achieving his scholarly goals represented a form of failure that was more painful than physical suffering. The psychological burden of unfinished work added another layer of stress to an already overwhelming situation.

## The Beginning of Recovery

By late 1943, So began to show signs of recovery from the worst effects of his physical decline. The herbal treatments he had developed proved somewhat effective in controlling his malarial symptoms, while the mutual support system among the prisoners helped ensure that he received adequate nutrition despite the general food shortage. Most importantly, his natural resilience began to reassert itself as he adapted to the harsh conditions of island life.

The recovery process was slow and uncertain, with periods of improvement alternating with relapses that threatened to undo his progress. However, the gradual stabilization of his physical condition enabled him to begin thinking once again about resuming his scholarly work. The dictionary project that had been suspended during his worst illness began to seem possible once more, though under very different circumstances than those he had enjoyed on Tarutao.

The psychological aspects of recovery were as important as the physical improvements. As his strength slowly returned, So began to regain confidence in his ability to survive and eventually complete his life's work. The sense of purpose that had sustained him through years of imprisonment was gradually restored, providing the motivation necessary for continued resistance against the forces that sought to destroy his spirit.

The support of his fellow prisoners was crucial to So's recovery. Men who were themselves struggling to survive continued to share their resources and take on additional burdens to protect their weakest companion. This demonstration of solidarity and human compassion provided psychological sustenance that was as important as physical nourishment in enabling So's gradual return to health.

As we shall see in @sec-liberation-legacy, So's survival of the ordeal on Koh Tao would prove to be the crucial turning point in his long imprisonment. The man who had nearly died on the island would emerge with his essential spirit intact and his commitment to his scholarly work undiminished. The dictionary that had seemed lost forever during the darkest days of his illness would eventually be completed and published, becoming a lasting testament to the power of intellectual dedication to transcend even the most extreme forms of physical and psychological adversity.
