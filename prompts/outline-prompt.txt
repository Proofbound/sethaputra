You are an expert book outline generator. Generate a detailed chapter outline for a book on the following topic:

**Topic:** {{topic}}
**Writing Style:** {{writing_style}}
**Target Audience:** General readers interested in {{topic}}

Please create an outline with 8-12 chapters that:
1. Starts with an engaging introduction
2. Builds knowledge progressively
3. Includes practical applications where relevant
4. Ends with a compelling conclusion

For each chapter, provide:
- A clear, engaging chapter title
- A 2-3 sentence description of what the chapter covers
- Estimated word count (aim for 3000-5000 words per chapter)
- Key points or subtopics to cover

Format your response as a YAML structure that matches this template:

```yaml
book:
  title: "{{title}}"
  description: "{{topic}}"
  target_length: 50000
  
chapters:
  - id: "intro"
    title: "Your Chapter Title Here"
    description: "Brief description of what this chapter covers and why it's important."
    target_words: 3500
    status: "pending"
    prompt_context:
      focus: "Key themes or focus areas for this chapter"
      tone: "{{writing_style}}"
  
  - id: "chapter-02"
    title: "Second Chapter Title"
    description: "Description of the second chapter content."
    target_words: 4000
    status: "pending"
    prompt_context:
      focus: "Specific focus for this chapter"
      tone: "{{writing_style}}"
```

Continue this pattern for all chapters. Make sure:
- Chapter IDs are unique and follow the pattern: intro, chapter-02, chapter-03, etc.
- Total word count across all chapters is around 40,000-60,000 words
- Each chapter builds on previous ones logically
- The outline is comprehensive yet focused on the core topic

Generate only the YAML content, no additional commentary.
