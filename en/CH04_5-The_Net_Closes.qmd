## The Phone Call That Changed Everything

November 11, 1933. So Sethaputra was at his office at Boonrod Brewery, where he served as managing director, when the phone rang that would seal his fate.

The voice on the other end belonged to Louis Kiriwat from the Bangkok Daily Mail. His words were urgent, almost breathless: "Something very important has happened. Come to the Daily Mail office immediately." So had worked closely with Louis during his years as Royal Spokesman—they shared not only professional ties but the bond of those who believed Thailand's future lay in constitutional monarchy, not revolutionary dictatorship.

When So arrived at the newspaper office, Louis's news was electrifying: Prince Bovoradej was marching south from Nakhon Ratchasima with his army, approaching Don Mueang airport on the outskirts of Bangkok. The prince was launching a counter-revolution to restore constitutional government and overthrow the military regime that had seized power the previous year.

"We need your help," Louis said. "Someone has to translate the manifesto into English."

## A Moment of Choice

For So Sethaputra, this was the moment when principle collided with prudence. He had resigned his government position immediately after the 1932 coup, unable to serve a regime he considered illegitimate. Since then, he had watched in growing alarm as the revolutionary government dismantled press freedoms, eliminated political opposition, and concentrated power in the hands of military officers who showed little understanding of democratic governance.

Prince Bovoradej's rebellion represented everything So believed in: the restoration of true constitutional monarchy, the return of democratic processes, and the end of military dictatorship. The manifesto he was asked to translate outlined six key demands that perfectly aligned with his own convictions:

1. True constitutional monarchy with the king under a genuine constitution
2. Legitimate political parties operating according to democratic principles  
3. Government formation and dissolution based on parliamentary majorities, not military force
4. Separation of civil servants and military officers from politics
5. Appointments based on merit and qualifications, not political connections
6. Royal prerogative in selecting certain categories of representatives

These demands represented the difference between genuine democracy and revolutionary authoritarianism. So's expertise in both Thai and English, combined with his experience in government communication, made him the ideal person to ensure the message reached international audiences.

## The Secret Printing Operation

The translation completed, So joined Louis Kiriwat and Phraya Saraphai Phipat in a mission that would ultimately doom them all. They made their way to a barge moored in the middle of the Chao Phraya River—the steamship MacIntosh, used for towing log rafts, but temporarily serving as a clandestine printing facility.

The choice of location was strategic: surrounded by water, the barge offered protection from sudden police raids. The conspirators could spot approaching boats from any direction and, if necessary, destroy evidence quickly. What they hadn't anticipated was how this isolated location would also become a trap.

As they worked to print the manifesto, the Roneo printing machine jammed. Without hesitation, So jumped forward to fix the mechanism, personally operating the machine to continue the printing. It was this moment of helpful competence that would later identify him beyond doubt to government witnesses.

The irony was cruel: So's technical skills and willingness to help—the same qualities that had made him an effective Royal Spokesman—now marked him as a key conspirator in the eyes of the revolutionary regime.

## The News That Shattered Everything

As the printing continued, a messenger arrived with devastating news: Prince Bovoradej's forces had been defeated by government troops and the prince was in retreat. The counter-revolution had failed before it truly began.

The reaction was swift and desperate. The conspirators immediately burned all the printed leaflets in the barge's cooking stove, watching their hopes for constitutional restoration turn to ash. They scattered separately, each hoping their involvement would remain undetected.

But it was too late. The boat's crew had witnessed everything, and the government was already closing its net around anyone connected to the rebellion. The witnesses who had seen So operating the printing machine would soon become the evidence that convicted him.

## The Widening Investigation

In the days following the failed rebellion, Bangkok's newspapers carried daily reports of arrests and interrogations. The government's response was systematic and thorough—they understood that allowing any conspirators to escape would invite future challenges to their authority.

The Bangkok Daily Mail itself came under immediate suspicion. Government investigators quickly identified the newspaper's staff as key players in preparing and distributing pro-rebellion materials. Louis Kiriwat, So Sethaputra, Phraya Saraphai Phipat, and Theun Mahaporayal were all named as primary suspects in what the government characterized as a treasonous conspiracy.

So continued working at Boonrod Brewery, maintaining his normal routine while knowing that discovery was inevitable. Friends later asked why he didn't flee when he clearly understood the danger. His answer revealed his character: he believed the illegitimate government would not last long, that justice would eventually prevail, and that running would only prove his guilt in the eyes of history.

This faith in eventual justice would cost So eleven years of his life.

## November 8, 1933: The Arrest

The end came, as it often does, on an ordinary working day. So was at his desk at Boonrod Brewery's offices, attending to the routine business of running Thailand's first successful beer company, when the police arrived.

There was no dramatic chase, no desperate resistance. The officers simply walked into his office and placed him under arrest. The witnesses from the barge had identified him as the man who had operated the printing machine, who had personally ensured the rebel manifesto would be produced and distributed.

So was taken first to police headquarters for interrogation, then to the third floor of the Ministry of Defense for detention. Finally, he was transferred to Bang Kwang prison to await trial alongside more than twenty other defendants in what would become known as the Bovoradej Rebellion case.

As the police led him away from his office, So carried with him only his dignity and an unshakeable belief that history would vindicate his actions. He had chosen principle over safety, constitutional democracy over revolutionary authoritarianism, and the rule of law over the rule of force.

The thirty-year-old mining engineer who had once served as the voice of the monarchy now became Prisoner Number 26, beginning a journey that would transform him from a spokesman for the old order into the creator of modern Thailand's most important educational resource.

## The Price of Principle

The arrest of So Sethaputra marked the end of one chapter in Thailand's political development and the beginning of another. The Western-educated elite who had believed in gradual constitutional reform found themselves branded as enemies of progress. The revolutionary government's victory was complete—not only had they defeated the military challenge to their rule, but they had also eliminated the intellectual opposition that might have provided alternative models for democratic development.

For So personally, the arrest represented a catastrophic disruption of a life carefully built around service to his country. His promising career in business ended abruptly. His comfortable middle-class existence vanished overnight. His role as a public intellectual and commentator on national affairs was terminated by prison walls.

Yet the arrest also marked the beginning of something unprecedented in Thai intellectual history. The man who had used his linguistic skills to serve the monarchy would soon begin using those same skills to serve the broader Thai people. The former Royal Spokesman would become Thailand's most important lexicographer, creating a dictionary that would educate generations of his countrymen.

In the cold stone corridors of Bang Kwang prison, So Sethaputra would discover that true service to one's country sometimes requires abandoning the corridors of power for the confines of a cell. His greatest work lay not behind him in the palaces and government offices where he had served, but ahead of him in the most unlikely of places—a maximum-security prison where political enemies of the state waited for justice that might never come.

The net had closed around So Sethaputra the political conspirator. But it had also inadvertently captured So Sethaputra the educator, whose most important contributions to Thai society had yet to be made.
